I am currently in my third year as a Graphic Design 
major here at MSU, but fifth year overall. I'm from Mexico 
and I'm in a Mariachi band as well. I was born and raised 
in Mexico and moved here 11 years ago. Back then, my brother used to
paint murals around our hometown for commissions.

It ranged from small business's to political party ads. Seeing him turn an empty space  on a wall to something that captivated everyone's attention was what got me into the art field itself. 
My love for Graphic Design started as I moved here and got
easier access to technology. also like to keep myself entertained with some of the following hobbies

I also love experimenting with new art styles and don't consider myself an artist with a definitive art style.

    <P> I also am a bit of a gamer. Ever since I remember we've had a console at home. Mostly Playstation, but I have played others. Video Games and their art style have also impacted the way I create my art, lately Red Dead Redemption 2 has inspired new ideas for me. The soundtrack and dense environment allow me to fully think outside of the "norm". It was also what opened the doors to look at art in an a very organic and naturalistic manner. Here's a few of my favorite games from the years.</P>
